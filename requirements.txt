# Runtime dependencies for mailbackup
# mailbackup primarily uses the Python standard library. The external tool `rclone`
# must be installed on the system separately (https://rclone.org/).
# Add any runtime pip packages here if/when the project gains non-stdlib deps.

# Example (uncomment to use):
# requests>=2.0
